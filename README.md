## âœ¨ What is chai-latte?

It's a tool for building expressive fluent interface libraries. <br/>
Think of it as a simple tool to buid libraries Ã  la [chaijs](https://www.chaijs.com/) but not necessarly related to testing. It can be about anyhting :).

## ðŸ¤” Motivation

<p>Building expressive fluent interfaces isn't easy. the more expressions you add the more it becomes un-maintainable. You'll quickly run into conflicts between expressions.</p>
<p>This tool will do all the heavy lifting for you, removing all the repetitive and soul crushing tasks needed do to create such libraries. Now, You can focus on adding expressions and it will just work! âœ¨.</p>


## ðŸ”Œ Installation
It's available on npm. To install it, type:

```sh
npm i chai-latte
```
or
```sh
yarn add chai-latte
```

## :rocket: Quick Start!

Lets create a library that will be able to create arrays and add number to it.
I know... The example is not exiting ðŸ˜…. But let's create it anyway! The library we'll create should be able to execute the command below:

```tsx
import example from './the/library/we/will/create';

const { create, add } = example;

const arr = create.an.array();
add(4).to.this.array(arr)
add(5).to(arr)

const arr2 = create.a.copy.of(arr);
add(5).to(arr2);
```

1. Let's create our first expression. The `expression` function takes two arguments. The first argument should be a function that shows how to use the expression. The second argument is the callback. See example below:

```ts
import { expression } from 'chai-latte';

const ourFirstExpression = expression(
  ({ create }) => create.an.array(), 
  () => {
    console.log('Array Created!');
    return [];
  }
);
```

2. Make the expression executable. `expression` alone just returns a configuration object. we should `compile` it in order to use it. See example:

```ts
import { expression, compile } from 'chai-latte';

const ourLibrary = compile(
  expression(
    ({ create }) => create.an.array(), 
    () => {
      console.log('Array Created!');
      return [];
    }
  )
);

// 

const { create } = ourLibrary;
const arr = create.an.array(); // [] and logged 'Array Created!'.
```

3. Add the other expressions! In order to do so, just add them as extra argument to the `compile` function. See example:

```ts
const addNumToArray = (num: number, arr: any[]) => arr.push(num);
const createArray = () : any[]=> [];
const cloneArray = (arr: any[]) : any[] => [...arr];

const ourLibrary = compile(
  expression(({ create }) => create.an.array(), createArray),
  expression(({ create }) => create.a.copy.of(Array), cloneArray),
  expression(({ add }) => add(Number).to.this.array(Array), addNumToArray),
  expression(({ add }) => add(Number).to(Array), addNumToArray),
);
```
4. Congrtulations!! ðŸŽ‰ You can now use your library! See example:

```ts
const { create, add } = ourLibrary;

const arr = create.an.array();
add(4).to.this.array(arr)
add(5).to(arr)
console.log(arr) // logs [4, 5]

const arr2 = create.a.copy.of(arr);
add(12).to(arr2);
console.log(arr2) // logs [4, 5, 12]
```

## ðŸ“š Typescript
To make your library type-safe, you can generate the corresponding typings using the command line. It will create a new file called `generated.ts` that will export the same fluent interface but fully typed. Then simply use this new file as your entry file!<br/><br/>
To create the `generated.ts` type this in the terminal:

```sh
npx chai-latte ./index.ts
```

## ðŸ™ˆ Things to know & Limitations

1. When creating expressions, you have to provide a class for each callable parts. This is how the engine avoid conflicts.
```tsx
// example
class Human {}
class Child extends Human {}

the(Human).can.jump(); // expression 1
the(Child).will.play(); // expression 2

// if we try to call
const human = new Human();
const child = new Child();
the(child).can.jump(); // <-- will work since Child inherits Human
the(human).will.play(); // <- won't work because .will.play() isn't defined for expression 1
```
2. The last word on an expression has to be function. It can accept an argument.
```tsx
// example
the(Human).works.up.until(Number);
the(Human).can.jump();
the(Human).is.alive // <- won't compile because it doesn't end with a function
```

3. Expressions that share the exact same code path and argument types cannot co-exist. Here is an example of 3 expressions to illustrate the issue:
```tsx
// example
the(Human).can.say('Hi!');
the(Baby).can.say('Hi!'); // <- will work, because Human and Baby are different classes
the(Baby).can.say('Hi!').and.say('I\'m hungry'); // <- won't compile
```
