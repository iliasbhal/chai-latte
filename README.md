## âœ¨ What is chai-latte?

Let's you create expressive & readable fluent interface libraries. <br/>
Think of it as a simple tool to buid things that looks like [chaijs](https://www.chaijs.com/) but it can do anything, not just testing :).

Building expressive fluent interfaces isn't easy as you can quickly run into conlficts between expressions. This tool will do all the heavy lifting for you. Just add expressions and watch it just work âœ¨.

## :rocket: Quick Start!

It's available on npm. To install it, type:

```sh
yarn add -D chai-latte
```

Then create an entry file that will hold all our functions.
As of now, let's export an empty array. We'll add expressions right after

```ts
// index.ts
export default [];
```

Add expressions and their callbacks to the array. Every element in the array is an array where the first element is the expression and the last element is the callback.

```ts
// index.ts
export default [
  [
    ({ the }) => check(Boolean).to.be(Boolean), // <- expression
    (bool: boolean, expected: boolean) => {
      // <- callback
      if (bool !== expected) {
        console.log("Booleans do not match!!");
        return false;
      }

      return true;
    },
  ],
  [
    ({ the }) => check.if(Number).to.be.greater.than(Number), // <- expression
    (num: number, num2: number) => {
      // <- callback
      if (num2 <= num1) {
        console.log(`${num} is not greater than ${num2}`);
        return false;
      }

      return true;
    },
  ],
];
```

Then generate the computed interface. Type in th terminal:

```
npx chai-latte ./index.ts
```

Congrtulations!! ðŸŽ‰ <br/>
The command line create a new file called `generated.ts` next to `index.ts`. This file is the entry file of your expressive fluent interface library. And It is type checked using typescript.

You can use like so:

```tsx
import { check } from "./generated";

check(true).to.be(true); // true
check(false).to.be(false); // false + will log: 'Booleans do not match!!';
check.if(10).to.be.greater.than(2); // true
```
